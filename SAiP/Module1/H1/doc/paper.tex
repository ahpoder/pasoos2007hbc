\begin{abstract}
  The HS07 system implements a closed-loop control of the heating in a
  private home. It monitors thermometers in the home, and based on
  measurements HS07 adjusts radiators in the home. This report gives a
  software architecture description of an architectural prototype of
  the HS07 system. The techniques used for architectural description
  are taken from \cite{christensen2004archdesc}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Figure~\ref{fig:hs07} shows a schematic overview of HS07 in a
home. The home may be accessed by the home owner from the outside
through the HS07 gateway. The HS07 gateway also monitors and controls
the home.

HS07 includes sensor and actuator hardware which runs on an embedded Java virtual
machine with standard software.

\section{Architectural Requirements}

For our purposes there is one main use case for the HS07 system:
\begin{quote}
  \emph{Control Temperature}: The gateway collects measurements from
  thermometers and reports this to radiators that then control the
  temperature.
\end{quote}

The major driving qualities attributes of the HS07 system
are\footnote{These qualities will be operationalized in Exercise 2}:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Performance.} HS07 should be performant so that a large
  number of thermometers and radiators may be part of the system.
\item \emph{Modifiability.} It must be possible to modify HS07 to
  include new types of sensors and actuators.
  \item $<<$Extra quality requirement that you consider important $>>$
\end{itemize}
