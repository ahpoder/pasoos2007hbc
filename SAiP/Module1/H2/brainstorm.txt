Quality attribute scenarios:

1. The home owner -> logs on to -> the system (normal opreation) -> creates a connection and reports status -> Maximum delay before response 1 second 95% of the time, 5 seconds 4% of the time, more than 5 seconds (unscheduled down-time) less than 1% of the time.

2. The user -> begin using -> the system (normal operation) -> understand basic functionality -> less than 1 hour.

3. The user -> attempts to turn radiator above normal safety-level from outside the house -> the system (normal operation) -> reports an error back to the user explaining the infraction and create a log entry -> the system do not execute illigal command.

4. An attacker -> attempts to log on -> the system (normal operation) -> system creates audit-trail, disconnects and go to degraded mode for 1 hour -> System do not allow IP to reattempt for 1 hour

5. The user -> create a new user -> the system (configuration mode) -> new user ready to log on -> System skales to 65536 users or as hardware allow
