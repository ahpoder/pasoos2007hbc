    Main definition of framework roles.
  </p>
<p>

    This package contains both definitions of framework roles in the form
    of interfaces for the main abstractions, as well as packages
    containing implementation of game variants. The standard package
    contains a small set of default implementations of simple roles.
  </p>

  <p>
  The central role is "Game" that acts as a facade to all
  manipulations and inspections  of a HotTargui game instance.
