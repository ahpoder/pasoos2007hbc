\section{Quality Attributes -- Beer Web Store}

Consider the following main use case for a Beer Web Store for specialty
beers:

\begin{quote}
  The customer browses the beer catalogue for descriptions and
  reviews. The customer selects appropriate beers for purchase and
  these are added to his shopping basket. When the customer checks
  out, payment is validated through the payment service
\end{quote}
The main architectural drivers are considered to be performance and
availability. Moreover, the software architect for the system has
created the following box-and-line drawing documenting his initial
ideas of the system:
