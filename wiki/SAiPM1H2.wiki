Page for Hand-in 2 of the Software Architecture in Practice couse at AU.

= Introduction =

Brainstorming, decentralized rantings in general.

 * AHP - What do developers care about? Looking over what I came up with, most of the goals (clear requirements, scalable and upgradeable) have root in business, as it will cause the development (or future development) to go faster.


= Details =

  * General progress
  * Step by step advancements
  * Takes care of "meetings" in our decentralized setting.

= Stakeholders and interests =

 * User (homeowner)
  * Easy to use and configure
  * Always available
  * Safe (will not make an error and burn down the house)
  * Secure (other people cannot control my home)
 * Producer
  * Cheap
  * Production line (modifiability for other uses)
  * Easily deployable (installable)
 * Developer (?)
  * Easily adjustable to new requirements
  * Scalable
  * Upgradeable
 * Insurance company
  * Safe with respect to fires (radiators) and breakins (door), ...

= Scenario Brainstorming =

  * A sensor stops responding.
  * Someone leaves a window open in an ice storm, and the sensors makes the actuators overheat.
  * Someone accidentally puts their stiletto through the Ethernet switch, disabling networking parts of the system.

 # The user -> begin using -> the system (normal operation) -> understand basic functionality -> less than 1 hour.
 # The user -> create a new user -> the system (configuration mode) -> new user ready to log on -> System skales to 65536 users or as hardware allow
 # The home owner -> logs on to -> the system (normal opreation) -> creates a connection and reports status -> Maximum delay before response 1 second 95% of the time, 5 seconds 4% of the time, more than 5 seconds (unscheduled down-time) less than 1% of the time.
 # The user -> attempts to turn radiator above normal safety-level from outside the house -> the system (normal operation) -> reports an error back to the user explaining the infraction and create a log entry -> the system do not execute illigal command.
 # An attacker -> attempts to log on -> the system (normal operation) -> system creates audit-trail, disconnects and go to degraded mode for 1 hour -> System do not allow IP to reattempt for 1 hour
